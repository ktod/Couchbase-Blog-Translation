Have some downtime during the holidays? Then you should join the Couchbase Mobile Holiday Mini-Hack Challenge and build an online/offline app in 30 minutes. That’s right – 30 minutes!

We created the mini hack to give mobile developers a fast, easy, and fun way to explore development with Couchbase Mobile. It consists of a small challenge involving a basic set of Couchbase Mobile APIs for building a mobile app that works both online and offline. And it can be done in 30 minutes.

The mini-hack is designed to stimulate developers of all skill levels—it comes with step-by-step instructions to guide you if you get stuck. You can find all of the details in this GitHub repository.

Check it out, have fun, and tell us what you think.

Happy Holidays!
